# Question 1

## Prompt
```
Define variables in the context of procedural languages for SQL, and state how they differ from SQL column values.
```

## Answers

- Definition: Variables in procedural languages for SQL are named storage locations that can hold a value of a specific data type during the execution of a program or procedure.
- Differences from SQL column values:
- Variables are temporary and exist only during procedure execution, while column values are persistent in database tables.
- Variables can be manipulated and updated within the procedure, while column values require SQL statements for modification.
- Variables have a scope limited to the procedure or block where they are declared, while column values are accessible across the entire database.
- Variables can hold intermediate results or control flow, while column values represent actual data stored in tables.
