## Answers

- System-defined exceptions:
- Predefined by the database system.
- Raised automatically when specific error conditions occur.
- Have predefined error codes and messages.
- Cover common database errors like constraint violations or resource limits.
- User-defined exceptions:
- Created and defined by the programmer.
- Raised explicitly in the code using RAISE or THROW statements.
- Can have custom error codes and messages.
- Used for handling application-specific error conditions not covered by system exceptions.
